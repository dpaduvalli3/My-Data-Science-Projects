<h3>About Word Count Visualization</h3>
<p>Before doing sentiment analysis, we tried to understand the structure of the data through word count visualization.</p>

<h3>We tried to describe our text through the following visualizations:</h3>
<p>
1.Word count analysis: interactive tables with tokens in descending order of frequency.<br/><br/>

2.Word count chart: bar chart showing frequency of top N tokens.<br/><br/>

3.Word cloud: visual representation of frequency (or importance) of words in our dataset.<br/><br/>

These visualizations help us understand what the keywords are and also the overall "theme" of our results.<br/><br/>

(Note: When viewing our visualizations please allow a few seconds for it to render)
