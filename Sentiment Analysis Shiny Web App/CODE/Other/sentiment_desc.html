<h3>About Sentiment Analysis</h3>
<p>Sentiment analysis, a subfield of natural language processing (NLP), refers to the automated extraction of feeling or opinion from a text document. It is most popularly used for analyzing online reviews. </p>

<h3>In order to quantitatively predict the sentiment of each token, we have used the following R dictionaries:</h3>
<p>
1.AFINN: assigns words with a score that runs between -5 and 5, with negative scores indicating negative sentiment and positive scores indicating positive sentiment.<br/><br/>

2.Bing: categorizes words in a binary fashion into positive and negative categories (positive/negative). <br/><br/>

3.NRC: assigns emotions for each tokenized word (ex: fear, happy).<br/><br/>

(Note: When viewing our visualizations please allow a few seconds for it to render)<br/><br/>
