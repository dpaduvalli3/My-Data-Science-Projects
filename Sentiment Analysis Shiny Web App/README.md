# Description
My application allows users to evaluate and analyze the sentiment of product reviews. I have used a static dataset of reviews from Amazon to build the models. Users will be able to manipulate graphs, sort the data by product name, average overall rating, average score and asin (amazon id number). 

# Installation/Prerequisites
In order to run the application, you will need to install R and R studio on your computer. Install the latest version of RStudio.
